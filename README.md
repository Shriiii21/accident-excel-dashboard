# Road Accident Dashboard
# **Project Overview**:
This repository hosts the codebase for a comprehensive Road Dashboard designed for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides valuable insights into road safety metrics, aiding in understanding and analyzing various aspects of road accidents and casualties. Developed for our client, this dashboard aims to enhance awareness and decision-making related to road safety.
# Problem Statement 
The client wants to create a Road Dashboard for years 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the below requirements:-
- **Primary KPI**- Total casualties taken place after the accident
- **Primary KPIs** - Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle
- **Secondary KPIs**- Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type
- Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
- Maximum casualties by Road Type
- Distribution of Total casualties by road surface
- Relation Between Casualties by Area / Location & by Day/Night
# Dataset 
The data used is road accident data of uk having 307K rows and 21 fields for the years 2021 and 2022. Data is stored in a single tab
## Data Cleaning
I've ensured data accuracy by removing duplicate entries from the dataset. To enhance data analysis, we've also created a "Month" and "Year" column from the "Accident Date" data, allowing for easy filtering and visualization based on these temporal dimensions. This data transformation ensures that the dashboard provides more meaningful insights and simplifies data exploration for users.

## Pivot Tables and Visualizations
I've leveraged pivot tables for data analysis and as a foundation for building the dashboard. I've also designed a range of visualizations, including Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), charts, and graphs to effectively convey critical insights derived from the dataset. These visual elements make the dashboard informative and user-friendly, providing a clear and actionable overview of the data.

## Building the Dashboard
I've constructed an interactive dashboard by integrating pivot tables and visualizations. I've taken care to customize the layout, appearance, and formatting of the dashboard to create an engaging and user-friendly experience. This ensures that users can efficiently explore and understand the data, making the dashboard a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making.

## Buttons, Filters and Slicers
In this Excel dashboard project, we've incorporated Buttons, Filters, and Slicers to enhance user interaction. Users can now explore specific data subsets with ease. Filters based on Accident Date, Urban, and Rural areas have been added, enabling users to refine their data views. Additionally, interactive buttons have been included to provide users with dynamic features, making the dashboard more engaging and user-friendly.
